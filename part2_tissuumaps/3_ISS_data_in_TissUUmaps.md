# Using TissUUmaps for exploring ISS data
By Christophe Avenel

## Data
- DAPI Image: `6_Base_1_stitched-1.tif`
- Markers: `Cell types.csv` and `Gene Counts.csv`
- Color dictionary: `color_dict.json`

## Gene counts
1. Install TissUUmaps: https://tissuumaps.github.io/download/
1. Load the DAPI image 6_Base_1_stitched-1.tif into TissUUmaps. You can do it by dragging and dropping the .tif image file into TissUUmaps space, or using the File > Open menu.
1. Inspect the Gene Counts.csv marker file in Excel to understand its structure. It contains three columns: X, Y and Gene (resp. X and Y coordinates of each point on the DAPI image, and its corresponding gene name).

1. Load the Gene Counts.csv marker file into TissUUmaps, either by drag and drop again, or through the Markers tab in TissUUmaps, using the `[+]` button.
1. Give a new name to the created Tab (for example: Gene Counts) and select X and Y columns as coordinates.
1. You can already display your markers by clicking on “Update view”. All markers will have the same color and be in one group named “All”.
1. In Render Options, group markers by Gene name, by selecting the Gene column as Key.
1. In Advanced Options, change the marker size factor to 0.1, to make all gene markers smaller.
1. “Update view” again, to see how markers are divided into different gene names, with different colors and shapes.
1. Hover your mouse on the ![](images/eye.png?raw=true "Eye") icon in the marker list to display one gene at a time, or select multiple genes using the checkboxes ![](images/checkbox.png?raw=true "Checkbox") on the left.

## Cell types
1. Load the Cell types.csv marker file into a new tab, either by drag and drop again, or using the [+] button.
1. Give a new name to the created Tab (for example: Cell types) and select X and Y columns as coordinates.
1. In Render options, group markers by Cell type, by selecting the Gene column as Key.
1. To use pre-selected colors, check the option “Use color from dictionary” in `Render Options > Color options`, and copy paste the content of the file
